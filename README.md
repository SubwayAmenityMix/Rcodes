"THE REBIRTH OF URBAN SUBCENTERS - How Subway Expansion Impacts the Spatial Structure and Mix of Amenities in European Cities"


ABSTRACT: The mixture of consumer amenities is an essential determinant for the livability and 
vibrancy of urban neighborhoods.  However, the factors impacting the location of consumer amenities 
are poorly understood. In face of urban sprawl and corresponding metro expansion efforts in urban 
outskirts, it is crucial to understand if metro expansion and the implicit accessibility improvement 
have a decentralizing effect on the economic activities. Metro expansion projects in Europeâ€™s diverse 
cities, known for their strong public transport culture, offer an interesting setting for testing this 
hypothesis in a cross-comparative study. Therefore, this paper assesses the impact of new metro station 
openings on the multifunctional quality of neighborhoods with respects to their equipment with consumer 
amenities in nine European cities between 2012 and 2018. To accurately capture this property, we propose 
a new entropy-based measure of the Multifunctionality of a local Amenity Mix integrating the idea of 
dissimilar diversity applied on the spatiotemporal amenity category dataset of Foursquare. Consequently, 
the impact of a new metro station on the density, diversity and type of consumer amenities is tested using 
Difference in Difference Regression and Propensity Score Matching. The study brings new insights into the 
role of metro transit for the local amenity mix and the heterogeneity between different types of consumer 
amenities.
