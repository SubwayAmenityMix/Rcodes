"THE REBIRTH OF URBAN SUBCENTERS - How Subway Expansion Impacts the Spatial Structure and Mix of Amenities in European Cities"


ABSTRACT: Why do some neighborhoods thrive, and others do not? While the importance of the local amenity mix has been established as a key determinant of local livability, its link to urban transport infrastructure remains understudied, partially due to a lack of data. Using spatiotemporal social media data from Foursquare, we analyze the impact of metro stations which opened between 2014 and 2017 on the amenity mix of surrounding neighborhoods in nine European cities: Rome, Milan, Barcelona, Budapest, Warsaw, Sofia, Vienna, Helsinki and Stuttgart. We study the impact of subway expansion on three properties of the local amenity mix: its density, multifunctionality, and the heterogeneity between amenity types. For this purpose, we propose a new measurement of multifunctionality, which calculates the entropy of the locally present amenity set incorporating the degree of similarity between amenity types. For causal inference, we use Spatial Difference-in-Difference Regression as well as Propensity Score Matching and Entropy Balancing. Our findings show that in most cities subway expansion significantly impacted local amenity density and multifunctionality and that especially Arts & Entertainment, Food venues and Nightlife respond strongly. Moreover, strong agglomeration forces seem to prevail, causing existing subcenters to benefit most from new metro stations.
